Project Highlights:

Designed a 4-layer PCB stack-up to enhance signal integrity and power distribution

Created and customized schematic symbols

Sourced many footprints and 3D model from SnapMagic and Ultra Librarian and also modified some footprint

Explored Differential Pair Routing For high-speed  signals

Used a TVS (Transient Voltage Suppression) diode to protect the microcontroller, USB interface, and power lines from sudden voltage spikes caused by ESD events.

Implemented strategic component placement and return path optimization to mitigate EMI issues, carefully planned layout and return paths to reduce noise, and enhanced board-level EMC performance to meet industry standards
